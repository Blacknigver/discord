If users select crypto, and crypto only, it will send ANOTHER embed before finally showing the price which will be:
Title: Crypto Currency.
Text: Please select what type of Crypto Coin you will be sending.

With that a selector, with the options:
1. Litecoin
Emoji: <:Litecoin:1371864997012963520>

If users select 'Dutch Payment Methods' it will show the embed:

if users selected crypto, add what type of crypto below it
**Crypto Coin:**

So an example embed with this implemented, where someone orders a rank boost, from mythic 1 to masters 2, also I just saw but make it there's 1 space between it, right now it says 'Mythic1' instead of 'Mythic 1', and let's say I send crypto, solana as type of crypto, the information embed would be:

I just saw we also currently dont have `and` to give the info a font, so heres how it looks now:
**Current Rank:**
Mythic1

**Desired Rank:**
Masters2

**Price:**
€89

Here's how it should look with that info I just gave u:
**Current Rank:**
`Mythic 1`

**Desired Rank:**
`Masters 2`

**Price:**
`€89`

**Payment Method:**
`Crypto`

**Crypto Coin:**

If users select 'Dutch Payment Methods' it will show the embed:
Title: Dutch Payment Method.
Text: Please select what type of Dutch Payment Method you will be sending.

Below that a selector with the options - Oh and by the way for those selectors the name on it should always be 'Select Payment Method', the same goes for other selectors used in selecting a payment method for accounts or the ticket panel:

1. Tikkie
Emoji: <:tikkie:1371869238259875922>


OPTION 2 (Bol.com giftcard) will only show if the price is below 100 euros, for prices above 100 IT WILL NOT SHOW!
2. Bol.com Giftcard
Description/Placeholder: Additional Fees may Apply - 20-50%
Emoji: <:bolcom:1371870572237160448>

if users selected crypto, add what type of crypto below it
**Crypto Coin:**
`the crypto coin they selected`

if users selected dutch payment methods, add
**Type of Payment:**
`what they selected, so Bol.com giftcard or tikkie`

this will be below the payments method





# More payment handling
So what we are gonna add is, it sends ANOTHER embed when someone opens a ticket, this embed will respond to the embed that shows the order information or for purchase account the last embed that was sent by the bot, it is very important it responds/replies to the embed that was sent last before this one


The embeds will depend on the payment method:
If the payment method is PayPal:
Send the embed:
Non-embed text: Mention the user
Title: PayPal Terms of Services
Text:

> <:shield:1371879600560541756>[+] If our PayPal Account gets locked, you will have to wait for us to unlock it, if we fail to unlock it no product or refund will be given.
> <:shield:1371879600560541756>[+] We will not be covering any transaction fees.

**Breaking any will result in additional fees being added - and may also result in no Product and no Refund.**

By clicking 'Confirm' you **Confirm you have read and agreed to the Terms of Services.**

To this add a green 'I Confirm I have read and agreed.' button with the emoji <:checkmark:1357478063616688304>

This button can ONLY be clicked by the user who opened the ticket, else it will not allow it.
If the button gets clicked, turn the button into a green sort of non-clickable already clicked button, like the type of button you have on the /list embed when you click 'Mark as Sold', so as I said it should be green and say '(user who clicked the button/opened the ticket since only that user can) Agreed to the Terms of Services.'

And it should send a follow up embed, replying to the previous embed:
Title: PayPal Payment Information
**PayPal E-Mail:**
`mathiasbenedetto@gmail.com`

**Make sure to follow the Terms of Services!**

This should have the button 'Copy E-Mail' in blue, with the emoji <:copy:1372240644013035671>
Whenever someone clicks this it sends an empheral which sends mathiasbenedetto@gmail.com in plain text, JUST THAT NOTHING ELSE

Tikkie:
non-embed text: mention user
Title: Tikkie Information
Text: 
**Payment Link:**
https://tikkie.me/pay/im6epjm7vgj0d48n04p4 

The link may have expired, if so, please click the 'Link Expired' button.

Add the button 'Copy Link' in blue, with the emoji <:copy:1372240644013035671>
Whenever someone clicks this it sends an empheral which sends https://tikkie.me/pay/im6epjm7vgj0d48n04p4  in plain text






Now some other stuff, to the 'Tikkie' embed add a 'Link Expired' button, in red, emoji: <:cross:1351689463453061130>, which will send the embed:
Non-embed text: <@658351335967686659>
Title: Link Expired
Text: The Payment Link has expired.

Please send a new, non-expired one.

Also add the button 'Payment Completed' button in green with the emoji <:checkmark:1357478063616688304>

After this send a follow-up empheral embed:
Title: Payment Completed
Text: Are you sure you have successfully sent the money?

Buttons: (xs) Confirm, in green, emoji: <:checkmark:1357478063616688304>
Cancel, in red, emoji: <:cross:1351689463453061130>

the 'x' infront of seconds is because there will be a 5 second countdown, so 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 during all those seconds the button will not be clickable, after the countdown ends the button turns into a regular 'Confirm' without (xs), or if x is 5 (5s) infront of it, 

if that is clicked it sends the embed:
non-embed text: <@658351335967686659>
Title: Payment Confirmed
Text: Please confirm you have received the payment.

With a confirm button on it, in green, color <:checkmark:1357478063616688304>, that ONLY 658351335967686659 can click. And a cancel button, color red, emoji <:cross:1351689463453061130>, that can ONLY be used by 658351335967686659

If cancel is clicked please remove the current buttons and edit it to a non-clickable (like for mark as sold for /list) red button with the text 'Payment has not been received.'

If it is clicked send the embed:
Non-embed text: <@&1303702944696504441>
Title: Boost Available
Text: This boost has been paid for and is now available!

Order Information:
(repeating the order information here)
`(enter the current rank/trophies or whatever) **To** (the desired rank, trophies, mastery etc)`
**Amount:** `(the amount the boost costs)`


To PayPal add the same button as for tikkie, with 'Payment Completed' which does the same exact thing, but with 1 small difference:
the embed after the client confirms they completed the payment has a different ping, and is:
if that is clicked it sends the embed:
non-embed text: <@986164993080836096>
Title: Payment Confirmed
Text: Please confirm you have received the payment.

and the confirm and cancel button on this, which pings role <@&1303702944696504441> , can only be used by 986164993080836096


and once again to IBAN also add the same button as for tikkie, the exact same one, where it also pings 658351335967686659 and where the last confirm and cancel button can only be used by 658351335967686659


For PayPal giftcard, do not add any button, however if a ticket with that payment method is opened, send the message:
<@774511191376265217> <@986164993080836096>
And delete it after 0,1 second like the greet ping whenever someone joins the server

For german apple giftcard, send the message: <@&1292933200389083196> <@1078003651701915779> and delete it after 1 second aswell same for pp giftcard and the greet

And for bol.com giftcard do the same thing, send the message: <@658351335967686659> and then delete it after 0,1 seconds


For crypto we're gonna do it a little differently:
Also add the button 'Payment Completed' button in green with the emoji <:checkmark:1357478063616688304>

However, if this is clicked, send a form that requests the TXid, or transfer ID of the deal, once this is entered, check it, and check if the recipient's wallet address matches our address, it ofcourse depends on the type of crypto, here are all addresses repeated:
Litecoin: LMEBUghAdAKKdNTtUBExHyN33b6JS75TkH
Solana: B9z5EhzPnPFf8t5CptAArYRFhzkrQkv1i7URz1pVSNdH
we are not doing this for bitcoin (fees)

If it is not a real/valid TXid tell them this.

The amount sent must match the exact amount of litecoin/solana as specified on the embed, if it does not, send the embed:
non-embed text: <@658351335967686659>
Title: Insufficient Amount
Text: An unsufficient amount has been sent.

Please resolve this.

If the TXid does match a transaction that sent the CORRECT AMOUNT to the CORRECT address, please sent a follow-up embed:
Title: Please wait 20 minutes ⏰
Text: This is so the transaction can be confirmed.

after 20 minutes you will re-check the transaction, if it has been FULLY confirmed, you will send the embed:
If it is clicked send the embed:
Non-embed text: <@&1303702944696504441>
Title: Boost Available
Text: This boost has been paid for and is now available!

Order Information:
(repeating the order information here)
`(enter the current rank/trophies or whatever) **To** (the desired rank, trophies, mastery etc)`
**Amount:** `(the amount the boost costs)`


If it has NOT been fully confirmed after 20 minutes, send the embed:
Non-embed text: After 20 minutes the transaction is still not fully confirmed.
Title: Please wait another 20 minutes ⏰
Text: This is so the transaction can be confirmed.

And once again check the confirm status after 20 minutes, when it's finally confirmed, sent the embed I showed u



BY THE WAY:
When checking the TXid of a transaction, check if the transaction was sent in the last 30 minutes, was it not, than REJECT THAT SHIT, DO NOT MAKE IT WORK! FOR EVERY coin, btc, ltc, solana everything, and please also store a TXid when it is used in a form, if it is later re-used, reject it, it must be a new (last 30m), not used before transfer ID.



We will do pretty much the same for bitcoin:
Add a payment confirmed button, request the TXid in the form, however if the TXid matches our wallet address for btc (bc1qcxrteqq6rgr4u5s6hg9n4d27zar22ssgzx7s8v) do not do the wait 20 minutes stuff, and do not check the amount of money, instead send the embed:

non-embed text: <@658351335967686659>
Title: Confirm Transaction
Text: Please confirm you have received the correct amount with all confirms.

With a confirm button on it, in green, color <:checkmark:1357478063616688304>, that ONLY 658351335967686659 can click. And a cancel button, color red, emoji <:cross:1351689463453061130>, that can ONLY be used by 658351335967686659

If cancel is clicked please remove the current buttons and edit it to a non-clickable (like for mark as sold for /list) red button with the text 'Payment has not been received.'

If it is clicked send the embed:
Non-embed text: <@&1303702944696504441>
Title: Boost Available
Text: This boost has been paid for and is now available!











Now some things are very important:
This is only for the ticket panel for now, when buying accounts, PAYPAL SHOULD NOT do the same thing as specified here, because ofcourse the payment methods for 'Purchase Account' for /list are different

For purchase account every payment method will do as specified above. However PayPal will NOT do the thing specified above, so send the Payment Terms of Services embed

Instead, when someone selects 'PayPal' for purchase account, all it does is send the message: <@658351335967686659> and it deletes that after 0,1s after sending








# what happens if the money isn't sent in a 30m timeframe, solana and litecoin ONLY


if the money was not sent in a 30 minute timeframe, DELETE the old embed, this is for solana and litecoin only by the way, and send the embed:

Title: Payment Failed
Text: Client failed to send the money in a 30 minute time frame.

with the button:
Send Again in green, emoji depends on the crypto, if it is litecoin the emoji is: <:Litecoin:1371864997012963520>, if it is solana the emoji is: <:Solana:1371865225824960633>

This will re-sent the crypto embed that shows the address and amount etc, however the amount of litecoin/solana will be updated to have the current price, since in 30 minutes or whenever the user clicks the button a lot will have changed, so edit the crypto amount to be updated to match the exact price
