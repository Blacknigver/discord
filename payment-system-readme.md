# Payment System Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Discord bot's payment system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Payment Method UI
- Changed button-based payment method selectors to `SelectMenu` widgets for a better user experience
- Updated all payment method descriptions to be more informative and clear
- Added German Apple Gift-card option that was missing
- Fixed descriptions in Dutch and Crypto payment menus

### 2. Payment Flow
- Added proper handlers for payment buttons in `handlers.js`
- Fixed PayPal terms confirmation button functionality
- Added handlers for crypto transaction forms and verification
- Implemented proper payment confirmation countdowns
- Added staff verification embeds for completed payments

### 3. Code Structure and Consistency
- Fixed duplicate function definitions in `ticketPayments.js`
- Standardized the `setupCryptoTimeout` function to use consistent parameters
- Made crypto payment tracking more consistent across different payment methods
- Fixed Bitcoin payment function to use the common timeout function
- Organized payment handlers in a separate file that can be merged into the main codebase

## Payment Handlers Added
The following payment handlers have been implemented:

1. `payment_method_select` - Handles selection of payment methods
2. `crypto_select` - Handles selection of cryptocurrency types
3. `dutch_method_select` - Handles selection of Dutch payment methods
4. `confirm_paypal_terms` - Handles confirmation of PayPal terms
5. `payment_completed_*` - Handlers for completed payments (PayPal, IBAN, Tikkie, crypto)
6. `crypto_tx_form` - Handles crypto transaction form submissions
7. `copy_*` - Handlers for copying payment information (addresses, amounts, etc.)
8. `confirm_payment` - Handles payment confirmation after countdown
9. `staff_confirm_payment` - Handles staff verification of payments
10. `resend_*_payment` - Handlers for resending payment information

## Implementation Notes

### Payment Method Selection
The payment method selection has been changed to use `SelectMenu` instead of buttons, providing:
- Clearer selection with descriptions
- Better categorization of payment methods
- More compact UI with dropdown

### Crypto Payment Tracking
We now consistently track:
- Payment channel ID
- Message ID
- Amount in crypto
- Price in euros
- User ID
- Timeout ID
- Start time

### Code Consistency
- All payment handlers follow a consistent pattern
- Error handling is improved throughout
- Timeouts are managed in a centralized way

## How to Use
1. Copy the payment handlers from `payment-handlers.js` into the `buttonHandlers` object in `handlers.js`
2. The updated `ticketPayments.js` file already contains the fixed functions with better descriptions
3. Test all payment flows to ensure the buttons and selects work correctly
